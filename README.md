A wrapper around luv's fs_event bindings that make it much easier to deal with.
fswatch's only function's documentation is provided below. Issues and PRs are

# Functions

## watch(filepath[, recursive], callback)

| Parameter | Type     | Optional |
| --------- | -------- |:--------:|
| filepath  | string   |          |
| recursive | boolean  |     âœ”    |
| callback  | function |          |

Attaches a watcher to either a file or directory to watch for changes. If
`recursive` is true, changes in directories will be reported (note that
`directory_changed` events will still be emitted for directories in the watched 
directory regardless of this value). The callback's parameters and a 
description of all events are included below.

### callback(err, event, filepath, stat)

| Parameter | Type        |
| --------- | ----------- |
| err       | nil, string |
| event     | string, nil |
| filepath  | string, nil |
| stat      | table, nil  |

In case of an error thrown by the event watcher or fs_stat, `err` will be set 
to the respective error string and all other arguments will be nil. If `err` 
is `nil` the event is processable. `filepath` will be a path the the relevant 
file or directory **relative to the watcher's directory**. `stat` will be the 
output of calling `fs_stat` on the file or directory, this may be nil or stale. 
The event string may be any of the events listed below:

#### created

A file was created

#### removed

A file was removed.  
note: `stat` will be stale or nil

#### file_changed

The content of the file changed, multiple of these events may be emitted for 
one edit if the file is cleared first.

#### directory_changed

Any attribute of the directory changed, or a file in the directory was changed 
or renamed.  
This is useful for monitoring when any file in a subdirectory has changed.
